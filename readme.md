# A Configuration

In Brief; This module exists to simplify and consolidate various files in a directory and to leverage other paths for generalized configuration.

Specifically, this module merges JSON files in various directories ("../config" by default) into a single exported module for reference while also merging default "global" JSON files as well to allow for "system" level configuration to be applied along with the "application" level configuration.
